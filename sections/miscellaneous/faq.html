                            <li><p>DiversityCraft is a community that was created back on the 4th February 2014 as a friendly and chill survival server with a few close people playing on it, since it's beginning the server never had any type of moderation or rules to follow.

                            <h3>How did it start?</h3>
                            <li><p>DiversityCraft started as a small group of in real life (IRL) friends who wanted to play togheter on a Minecraft server that had something special from the rest, but they couldn't found it. One of them decided to create a server for them so that they could customize it however they liked. They all agreed that server needed to have as much freedom as possible in order to make them to whatever they want.</p></li>

                            <h3>What happened to the community?</h3>
                            <li><p>The community has always been a very small one, but in the past years more and more people have lost interest due to the server being dead for economic issues, until now, ready to come back with the remaining people!</p></li>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>What happened to the original map?</h3>
                            <li><p>The original map has been lost due to a severe hardware failure, the 2 HHD that contained the map and it's backup failed simultaneously. From now on the server will have not 2 but 3 backups in 3 different places.</p></li>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>Can i use cheats on the server?</h3>
                            <li><p>Of course you can use cheats, not that we invite you to use them since they might be malware but you won't be punished for that, feel free to play with whatever mods/clients you want.</p></li>

                            <h3>Is there any type of moderation?</h3>
                            <li><p>Moderation on the server dosen't exist, but the owner might step in if there's any attempt to damage, lag, or crash the server, you won't be punished but the lag machine will be removed.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Technically yes, but we don't like to define it directly anarchy, we prefere to define it as a free-for-all server where players can play on it however they like to.</p></li>
