                    <h3>20/09/24 - Longest bridge?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A small group of players lead by "MonkeBanana1998" recently started working on the biggest project in the new world, building a bridge that connects all Minecraft biomes in a straight line, useful for new people to find their favourite biome, the end goal of the project is to reach the desert biome, at the moment the bridge stretches for more than 9000 blocks towards south! Let's see if they will ever manage to reach their final goal!

                    <h3>25/08/24 - What a good looking spawn!</h3>
                    <p>
                        It seems like after the start of the new fresh world, the players immediatly started decorating, building and terraforming the server's spawn (at coordinates X 0, Z 0, the center of the world), making it look better and welcoming for new players. This reminds of the 2014's start, where griefing was unthinkable back then, since the playerbase wasn't interested in destroying the landscape, but rather make it look good with their building ideas! Let's hope it lasts for a long as possible!
